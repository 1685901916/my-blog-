Markdown directives are first parsed with [remark-directive][] \nwhich needs to be used before this plugin.\n\n**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees\n(ASTs).\n**remark** adds support for markdown to unified.\n**rehype** adds support for HTML to unified.\n**mdast** is the markdown AST that remark uses.\n**hast** is the markdown AST that rehype uses.\nThis is a remark plugin that transforms mdast.\n\n## When should I use this?\n\nThis project is useful when you want directives parsed by [remark-directive][] to be later parsed as\nHTML ([hast][] nodes) when using [remark-rehype][]. This is specifically useful when one wants to\nconvert Markdown directives into HTML tags that can be outputted as components with \n[react-markdown][].\n\n## Installation\n\nThis package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).\nIn Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [yarn][] or [npm][] :\n\n```sh\nyarn add remark-directive-rehype\nnpm install remark-directive-rehype\n```\n\nIn Deno with [Skypack][]:\n\n```js\nimport remarkDirectiveRehype from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-directive-rehype'\n```\n\nIn browsers with [Skypack][]:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import remarkDirectiveRehype from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-directive-rehype?min'\n</script>\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nSay we have the following file, `example.md`:\n\n```markdown\n:::documentation-page{title=\"Welcome\"}\n\nPlease install :inline-code[unified]!\n\n::copyright-notice{year=\"2020\"}\n\n:::\n```\n\nAnd our module `example.js` looks as follows:\n\n```js\nimport {read} from 'to-vfile'\nimport {unified} from 'unified'\nimport remarkParse from 'remark-parse'\nimport remarkDirective from 'remark-directive'\nimport remarkDirectiveRehype from 'remark-directive-rehype'\nimport remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'\nimport rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'\n\nmain()\n\nasync function main() {\n  const file = await unified()\n    .use(remarkParse)\n    .use(remarkDirective)\n    .use(remarkDirectiveRehype)\n    .use(remarkRehype)\n    .use(rehypeStringify)\n    .process(await read('example.md'))\n\n  console.log(String(file))\n}\n```\n\nNow running `node example` yields:\n\n```html\n<documentation-page title=\"Welcome\">\n  <p>Please install <inline-code>unified</inline-code>!</p>\n  <copyright-notice year=\"2020\"></copyright-notice>\n</documentation-page>\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example: `react-markdown`\n\nYou can use it with [react-markdown][] to render custom React components for each defined directive.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactDom from 'react-dom'\nimport ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'\nimport remarkDirective from 'remark-directive'\nimport remarkDirectiveRehype from 'remark-directive-rehype'\n\nconst markdown = `\n# Cat videos\n\n::youtube-video[Video of a cat in a box]{#01ab2cd3efg}\n`\n\nconst YouTubeVideo = ({id, children}) => (\n  <iframe\n    src={'https://www.youtube.com/embed/' + id}\n    width=\"200\"\n    height=\"200\"\n  >\n    {children}\n  </iframe>\n)\n\nReactDom.render(\n  <ReactMarkdown\n    children={markdown}\n    remarkPlugins={[remarkDirective, remarkDirectiveRehype]}\n    components={{\n      'youtube-video': YouTubeVideo\n    }}\n  />,\n  document.body\n)\n```\n\nYields:\n\n```html\n<h1>Cat videos</h1>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/01ab2cd3efg\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">Video of a cat in a box</iframe>\n```\n\n### Example: `rehype-components`\n\nYou can use in conjunction with [rehype-components][] to render components made with [hastscript][].\n\n```js\n// …\n\nconst file = await unified()\n  .use(remarkParse)\n  .use(remarkDirective)\n  .use(remarkDirectiveRehype)\n  .use(remarkRehype)\n  .use(rehypeComponents, {\n    components: {\n      'documentation-page': DocumentationPage,\n      'inline-code': InfoBox,\n      'copyright-notice': CopyrightNotice,\n    },\n  })\n  .use(rehypeStringify)\n  .process(await read('example.md'))\n\nconsole.log(String(file))\n```\n\nSee [rehype-components][] for more information on how to implement the components.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are always welcome!\n\nSee [`./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for
