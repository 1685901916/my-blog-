This section does not apply to you, the VS Code extension includes both Prettier and the Astro plugin by default.\n\nThe Astro language server uses Prettier to format Astro files, but does not include `prettier` or `prettier-plugin-astro` by itself as dependencies in order to keep the dependency count low and allow users to better control the version of Prettier they want to use.\n\nAs such, if you want to use formatting, you'll need to install `prettier` and `prettier-plugin-astro` as dependencies in your project.\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-27T02:39:43.761Z","modified":"2025-11-10T15:49:02.677Z","0.8.4":"2021-12-13T20:04:01.201Z","0.8.3":"2021-12-06T14:50:16.866Z","0.8.2":"2021-12-01T15:47:38.338Z","0.8.1":"2021-11-12T00:57:52.105Z","0.7.19":"2021-10-22T17:58:36.654Z","0.7.18":"2021-10-11T12:50:48.656Z","0.7.17":"2021-09-29T19:20:17.457Z","0.7.16":"2021-09-29T15:08:43.245Z","0.7.15":"2021-09-21T19:29:13.187Z","0.7.14":"2021-09-21T18:45:50.540Z","0.7.13":"2021-09-16T15:57:40.297Z","0.7.12":"2021-09-16T13:18:39.493Z","0.7.11":"2021-09-15T12:57:35.675Z","0.7.10":"2021-09-13T17:24:24.490Z","0.7.9":"2021-09-13T13:15:47.755Z","0.7.8":"2021-09-13T12:29:40.937Z","0.7.7":"2021-09-10T19:08:44.391Z","0.7.6":"2021-09-10T16:40:13.881Z","0.7.3":"2021-09-10T13:34:35.983Z","0.7.2":"2021-09-09T14:22:05.869Z","0.7.1":"2021-09-02T16:51:39.519Z","0.7.0":"2021-09-01T18:44:29.478Z","0.6.0":"2021-08-11T20:36:26.635Z","0.5.0":"2021-06-16T18:12:22.952Z","0.5.0-next.1":"2021-06-16T17:58:41.783Z","0.5.0-next.0":"2021-06-16T17:52:56.148Z","0.8.5":"2021-12-21T11:59:15.261Z","0.8.6":"2022-01-04T14:45:53.042Z","0.8.7":"2022-01-18T17:25:25.004Z","0.8.8":"2022-01-20T19:52:17.288Z","0.8.9":"2022-02-28T20:32:48.767Z","0.8.10":"2022-03-03T19:23:15.593Z","0.9.0":"2022-03-03T19:41:37.746Z","0.9.1":"2022-03-04T16:08:58.247Z","0.9.2":"2022-03-07T16:12:03.543Z","0.9.3":"2022-03-07T20:57:44.282Z","0.11.0":"2022-03-11T13:58:28.027Z","0.12.0":"2022-03-16T20:05:10.189Z","0.12.1":"2022-03-17T17:30:30.593Z","0.13.0":"2022-03-23T17:44:44.452Z","0.13.1":"2022-03-23T18:44:16.760Z","0.13.2":"2022-03-23T19:58:11.448Z","0.13.3":"2022-03-30T13:01:07.071Z","0.13.4":"2022-04-04T16:35:27.007Z","0.14.0":"2022-04-12T16:49:40.817Z","0.15.0":"2022-04-20T14:05:14.256Z","0.16.0":"2022-04-27T14:45:59.783Z","0.16.1":"2022-05-04T14:42:23.200Z","0.17.0":"2022-05-11T17:00:07.326Z","0.18.0":"2022-05-18T15:21:55.277Z","0.18.1":"2022-05-19T16:01:55.576Z","0.19.0":"2022-05-19T17:35:51.947Z","0.19.1":"2022-05-25T17:57:53.897Z","0.19.2":"2022-05-27T18:00:26.087Z","0.19.3":"2022-06-21T13:54:49.880Z","0.19.4":"2022-06-24T15:57:48.874Z","0.19.5":"2022-07-13T13:55:23.545Z","0.19.6":"2022-07-13T14:07:33.798Z","0.20.0":"2022-07-13T14:17:17.173Z","0.20.1":"2022-07-20T14:33:49.874Z","0.20.3":"2022-07-27T13:23:16.162Z","0.21.0":"2022-08-10T19:46:54.462Z","0.21.1":"2022-08-12T15:34:50.761Z","0.22.0":"2022-08-16T16:38:28.824Z","0.23.0":"2022-08-24T15:30:03.326Z","0.23.1":"2022-08-31T15:56:00.055Z","0.23.2":"2022-09-01T15:57:38.041Z","0.23.3":"2022-09-01T16:05:56.237Z","0.24.0":"2022-09-07T20:10:21.730Z","0.24.1":"2022-09-08T12:50:01.616Z","0.25.0":"2022-09-14T13:43:32.872Z","0.26.0":"2022-09-14T13:57:21.482Z","0.26.1":"2022-09-14T15:24:55.743Z","0.26.2":"2022-09-14T15:36:33.872Z","0.27.0":"2022-09-21T15:22:55.915Z","0.28.0":"2022-10-20T14:35:35.490Z","0.28.1":"2022-10-20T16:10:23.956Z","0.28.3":"2022-11-08T16:37:57.867Z","0.29.0":"2022-11-14T20:42:32.583Z","0.29.1":"2022-11-16T13:07:48.539Z","0.29.2":"2023-01-03T13:33:22.572Z","0.29.3":"2023-01-03T13:41:53.994Z","0.29.4":"2023-01-10T13:01:10.320Z","0.29.5":"2023-01-23T18:14:12.913Z","0.29.6":"2023-02-15T13:47:29.662Z","0.29.8":"2023-04-27T08:24:41.129Z","1.0.0":"2023-05-01T09:50:41.998Z","1.0.1":"2023-05-03T15:04:04.865Z","1.0.2":"2023-05-03T15:11:01.513Z","1.0.3":"2023-05-03T15:30:05.067Z","1.0.4":"2023-05-03T16:56:45.691Z","1.0.5":"2023-05-11T18:17:19.854Z","2.0.0-next.0":"2023-05-12T08:27:12.020Z","2.0.0-next.6":"2023-05-23T16:04:14.142Z","2.0.0-next.7":"2023-05-23T16:41:41.307Z","2.0.0-next.8":"2023-05-29T11:58:30.517Z","1.0.8":"2023-05-30T10:29:09.672Z","2.0.0-next.9":"2023-05-31T11:16:20.924Z","2.0.0-next.10":"2023-06-02T12:31:41.666Z","2.0.0-next.11":"2023-06-02T12:49:28.265Z","2.0.0-next.12":"2023-06-02T18:01:05.358Z","2.0.0":"2023-06-02T19:56:33.755Z","2.0.14":"2023-06-06T13:22:50.618Z","2.0.15":"2023-06-06T16:47:15.019Z","2.0.16":"2023-06-09T12:00:22.964Z","2.0.17":"2023-06-09T13:56:31.521Z","2.1.0":"2023-07-17T13:34:56.050Z","2.1.2":"2023-07-26T17:24:52.640Z","2.1.3":"2023-07-26T20:28:07.003Z","2.1.4":"2023-07-28T16:15:39.235Z","2.2.0":"2023-07-31T17:38:22.842Z","2.3.0":"2023-08-23T14:27:27.936Z","2.3.1":"2023-08-24T12:17:49.963Z","2.3.2":"2023-08-30T12:00:37.689Z","2.3.3":"2023-09-05T17:02:17.010Z","2.3.4":"2023-10-12T19:46:25.859Z","2.4.0":"2023-10-12T20:16:26.375Z","2.4.1":"2023-10-24T19:25:13.889Z","2.5.0":"2023-10-30T10:43:21.364Z","2.5.1":"2023-10-30T12:27:45.132Z","2.5.2":"2023-11-02T11:44:22.495Z","2.5.3":"2023-12-11T16:45:59.382Z","2.5.4":"2023-12-15T18:15:44.084Z","2.5.5":"2023-12-21T20:50:36.088Z","2.6.0":"2024-01-08T19:45:31.903Z","2.6.1":"2024-01-09T01:54:03.776Z","2.6.2":"2024-01-09T06:26:45.508Z","2.6.3":"2024-02-08T08:34:20.603Z","2.7.0":"2024-02-08T14:55:01.747Z","2.7.1":"2024-02-08T17:42:15.926Z","2.7.2":"2024-02-09T12:44:41.408Z","2.7.3":"2024-02-12T09:10:39.352Z","2.7.4":"2024-02-13T10:40:36.577Z","2.7.5":"2024-02-20T12:07:39.537Z","2.7.6":"2024-02-26T15:57:37.660Z","2.7.7":"2024-03-11T12:49:27.845Z","2.8.0"
