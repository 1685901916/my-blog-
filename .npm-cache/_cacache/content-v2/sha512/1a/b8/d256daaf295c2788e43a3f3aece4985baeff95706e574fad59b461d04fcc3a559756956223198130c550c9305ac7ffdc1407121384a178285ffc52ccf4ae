The TSX can be type checked using the included `svelte-jsx.d.ts` and `svelte-shims.d.ts`.\n\n_This project only converts svelte to tsx, type checking is left to consumers of this plugin such as language services_\n\n```typescript\ntype SvelteCompiledToTsx = {\n    code: string;\n    map: import('magic-string').SourceMap;\n};\n\nexport default function svelte2tsx(svelte: string): SvelteCompiledToTsx;\n```\n\nFor example\n\nInput.svelte\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    export let world = 'name';\n</script>\n\n<h1>hello {world}</h1>\n```\n\nwill produce this ugly but type checkable TSX\n\n```tsx\n<></>;\nfunction render() {\n    let world = 'name';\n    <>\n        <h1>hello {world}</h1>\n    </>;\n    return { props: { world }, slots: {}, events: {} };\n}\n\nexport default class _World_ extends __sveltets_2_createSvelte2TsxComponent(\n    __sveltets_2_partial(__sveltets_2_with_any_event(render))\n) {}\n```\n\nwith a v3 SourceMap back to the original source.\n\nFor more examples of the transformations, see the `test/**/samples` folders\n\n## Credits\n\n-   [halfnelson](https://github.com/halfnelson) for creating `svelte2tsx`\n-
