This plugin will improve that:\n\n- **Announce page visits** to screenreaders by reading the new page title\n- **Restore focus** after swapping out the content\n- **Skip animations** for users with a preference for reduced motion\n\nAccessibility can be hard to get right. That's why we're keen to hear your feedback. Share your\nexperience and suggest improvements by [opening an issue](https://github.com/swup/a11y-plugin/issues/new/choose)\non this repo. Let's make swup better together!\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the plugin from npm and import it into your bundle.\n\n```bash\nnpm install @swup/a11y-plugin\n```\n\n```js\nimport SwupA11yPlugin from '@swup/a11y-plugin';\n```\n\nOr include the minified production file from a CDN:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@swup/a11y-plugin@5\"></script>\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo run this plugin, include an instance in the swup options.\n\n```javascript\nconst swup = new Swup({\n  plugins: [new SwupA11yPlugin()]\n});\n```\n\n## Markup\n\nThe plugin should work out of the box if you use proper semantic markup for your content, i.e. a\ndescriptive `h1` for each page heading. See the options below for customizing what tags to look for.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```html\n<body> <!-- will be focused -->\n  <header>\n    Logo\n  </header>\n  <main>\n    <h1>Page Title</h1> <!-- will be announced -->\n    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>\n  </main>\n</body>\n```\n\n## Announcements\n\nThe plugin will announce the new page to screen readers after navigating to it. It will look for the\nfollowing and announce the first one found:\n\n- Heading label: `<h1 aria-label=\"About\"></h1>`\n- Heading content: `<h1>About</h1>`\n- Document title: `<title>About</title>`\n- Page URL: `/about/`\n\nThe easiest way to announce a page title differing from the main heading is using `aria-label`. The\nexample below will be announced as `Homepage`.\n\n```html\n<h1 aria-label=\"Homepage\">Project Title</h1>\n```\n\n## Focus\n\nOn page navigation, the plugin will reset focus to the body, imitating default browser behavior.\nWhen clicking anchor links on the same page, the plugin will focus the target of the link.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> When linking to other sections on the page, make sure to target a single item that is descriptive\n> of the section, e.g. a heading or a button. Linking to a large container has multiple issues:\n> Some browsers will scroll to the center of the targeted container, disorienting near-sighted users\n> with increased zoom. Screen readers will also start reading out the content of the targeted\n> element, which can be overwhelming when a whole content section is being read out.\n\n## Styling\n\nBrowsers will display a visible outline around elements focused by this plugin. That's great for\norientation of keyboard users, but tends to be annoying for mouse users. We can make both groups of\nusers happy by using a combination of the `:focus` and `:focus-visible` pseudo-class to hide any\nfocus outlines while the site is being used with a mouse:\n\n```css\n:focus:not(:focus-visible) {\n  outline: none;\n}\n```\n\nSee these guides on [Controlling focus](https://web.dev/control-focus-with-tabindex/)\nand [Styling focus](https://web.dev/style-focus/) for details and more examples.\n\n## Options\n\nAll options with their default values:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  headingSelector: 'h1',\n  respectReducedMotion: true,\n  autofocus: false,\n  announcements: {\n    visit: 'Navigated to: {title}',\n    url: 'New page at {url}'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### headingSelector\n\nThe selector for finding page headings. The content of the first found heading will be read to\nscreenreaders after a new page was loaded.\n\n### respectReducedMotion\n\nWhether to respects users' preference for reduced motion.\n\nDisable animated page transitions and animated scrolling if a user has enabled a\nsetting on their device to minimize the amount of non-essential motion. Learn more about\n[prefers-reduced-motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion).\n\n### autofocus\n\nWhether to focus elements with an `autofocus` attribute after navigation.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Make sure to use this wisely. Automatically focussing elements can be useful to draw attention to\n> inputs, but it comes with a list of drawbacks on its own, especially for screen-reading technology.\n> See [Autofocus accessibility considerations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus#accessibility_considerations)\n> for details.\n\n### announcements\n\nHow the new page is announced. A visit is announced differently depending on whether the new page\nhas a title or not. If found, the main heading or document title is announced. If neither is found,\nthe new url will be announced instead:\n\n- **Title found?** Read `announcements.visit`, replacing `{title}` with the new title\n- **No title?** Read `announcements.visit` too, but replacing `{title}` with the content of `announcements.url`\n\n```js\n{\n  announcements: {\n    visit: 'Navigated to: {title}',\n    url: 'New page at {url}'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Translations\n\nFor multi-language sites, pass in a nested object keyed by locale. The locale must match the\n`html` element's [lang](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/lang) attribute\nexactly. Use an asterisk `*` to declare fallback translations.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Swup will not update the lang attribute on its own. For that, you can either install the\n> [Head Plugin](https://swup.js.org/plugins/head-plugin/) to do it automatically, or you can do update\n> it yourself in the `content:replace` hook.\n\n```js\n{\n  announcements: {\n    'en-US': {\n      visit: 'Navigated to: {title}',\n      url: 'New page at {url}'\n    },\n    'de-DE': {\n      visit: 'Navigiert zu: {title}',\n      url: 'Neue Seite unter {url}'\n    },\n    'fr-FR': {\n      visit: 'Navigué vers : {title}',\n      url: 'Nouvelle page à {url}'\n    },\n    '*': {\n      visit: '{title}',\n      url: '{url}'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Visit object\n\nThe plugin extends the visit object with a new `a11y` key that can be used to customize the\nbehavior on the fly.\n\n```js\n{\n  from: { ... },\n  to: { ... },\n  a11y: {\n    announce: 'Navigated to: About',\n    focus: 'body'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### visit.a11y.announce\n\nThe text to announce after the new page was loaded. This is the final text after choosing the\ncorrect language from the [announcements](#announcements) option and filling in any placeholders.\nModify it to read a custom announcement.\n\nSince the text can only be populated once the new page was fetched and its contents are available,\nthe only place to inspect or modify this would be right before the `content:announce` hook.\n\n```js\nswup.hooks.before('content:announce', (visit) => {\n  visit.a11y.announce = 'New page loaded';\n});\n```\n\n### visit.a11y.focus\n\nThe element to receive focus after the new page was loaded, by default the `body`. Can be customized\nper visit. Set it to a selector `string` to select an element, or set it to `false` to not move the\nfocus on this visit.\n\n## Hooks\n\nThe plugin adds two new hooks: `content:announce` and `content:focus`. Both run directly\nafter the internal `content:replace` handler, when the new content is already in the DOM.\n\n### content:announce\n\nExecutes the announcement of the new page title.\n\n```js\nswup.hooks.on('content:announce', () => console.log('New content was announced'));\n```\n\n### content:focus\n\nExecutes the focussing of the new page.\n\n```js\nswup.hooks.on('content:focus', () => console.log('New content received focus'));\n```\n\n## Methods on the swup instance\n\nThe plugin adds the following method to the swup instance:\n\n### announce\n\nAnnounce something programmatically. Use this if you are making use of\n[`options.resolveUrl`](https://swup.js.org/options/#resolve-url) and still want\nstate changes to be announced.\n\n```js\nswup.announce?.(`Filtered by ${myFilterString}`);\n```\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-27T21:12:04.294Z","modified":"2024-04-29T18:55:11.841Z","1.0.0":"2020-08-10T20:46:59.221Z","2.0.0":"2021-03-14T23:46:36.648Z","2.1.0":"2022-08-20T22:55:39.881Z","3.0.0":"2023-03-10T13:41:52.924Z","4.0.0":"2023-07-26T09:00:35.457Z","4.1.0":"2023-07-30T11:04:04.481Z","4.1.1":"2023-08-08T10:40:44.324Z","4.2.0":"2023-08-20T20:25:00.761Z","4.3.0":"2023-08-30T15:18:42.571Z","4.4.0":"2023-09-19T15:36:21.209Z","4.4.1":"2023-09-26T12:01:45.193Z","4.4.2":"2023-10-27T08:27:40.009Z","4.5.0":"2023-11-21T12:35:42.911Z","4.5.1":"2024-04-02T16:58:42.109Z","4.5.2":"2024-04-15T13:51:02.564Z","5.0.0":"2024-04-29T10:18:13.682Z"},"versions":{"1.0.0":{"name":"@swup/a11y-plugin","version":"1.0.0","description":"Enhanced
