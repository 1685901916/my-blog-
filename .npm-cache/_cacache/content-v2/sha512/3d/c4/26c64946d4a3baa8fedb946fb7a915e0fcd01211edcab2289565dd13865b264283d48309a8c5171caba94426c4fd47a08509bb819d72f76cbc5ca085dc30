It manages the complete page load lifecycle\nand smoothly animates between the current and next page. In addition, it offers many other\nquality-of-life improvements like **caching**, **smart preloading**, native **browser history** and\nenhanced **accessibility**.\n\nMake your site feel like a snappy single-page app — without any of the complexity.\n\n## Features\n\n- ✏️ Works out of the box with [minimal markup](https://swup.js.org/getting-started/example/)\n- ✨ Auto-detects [CSS transitions](https://swup.js.org/getting-started/how-it-works/) & animations for perfect timing\n- 🔗 Updates URLs and preserves native [browser history](https://swup.js.org/options/#animatehistorybrowsing)\n- 🏓 Manages the scroll position between pages and anchor links\n- 🚀 Uses a [cache](https://swup.js.org/api/cache/) to speed up subsequent page loads\n- 📡 Offers [hooks](https://swup.js.org/hooks/) to customize and extend the page load lifecycle\n- 🔌 Has a powerful [plugin system](https://swup.js.org/plugins/) and many official and third-party plugins\n- 🎨 Provides ready-to-go [themes](https://swup.js.org/themes/) to get started quickly\n\n## Demos\n\nExplore our [interactive demos](https://swup.js.org/getting-started/demos/) to see swup in action.\n\n## Documentation\n\nVisit our [official documentation](https://swup.js.org/getting-started) to learn more.\n\n## Plugins\n\nSwup is small by design. Extended features can be added via [plugins](https://swup.js.org/plugins/):\n\n- Display a [progress bar](https://swup.js.org/plugins/progress-plugin/) while loading\n- Enable [smooth scrolling](https://swup.js.org/plugins/scroll-plugin/) between visits\n- Update [meta tags and stylesheets](https://swup.js.org/plugins/head-plugin/) after page loads\n- Add support for [preloading pages](https://swup.js.org/plugins/preload-plugin/) in the background\n- Improve [accessibility](https://swup.js.org/plugins/a11y-plugin/) for screen readers\n- Perform your [animations in JS](https://swup.js.org/plugins/js-plugin/) instead of CSS transitions\n- Animate [form submissions](https://swup.js.org/plugins/forms-plugin/)\n- Get help in [debug mode](https://swup.js.org/plugins/debug-plugin/)\n\nCheck out the list of [official plugins](https://swup.js.org/plugins/) and [third-party integrations](https://swup.js.org/third-party-integrations/).\n\n## Themes\n\nGet started quickly with one of three official themes: [fade](https://swup.js.org/themes/fade-theme/),\n[slide](https://swup.js.org/themes/slide-theme/), and [overlay](https://swup.js.org/themes/overlay-theme/).\n\n## Examples\n\n<img
